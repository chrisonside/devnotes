#Object Oriented JavaScript
JavaScript is not a classic OO language - it's a PROTOTYPAL one. 

#####Illustrating OOP concepts
* Bob is a man - an object 
* Bob's date of birth is 1 Nov 1979 - property
* Bob can eat, sleep and drink - methods
* Bob is an instance of class Web Developer - class (in classical OO - not JavaScript though, as there are no classes and everything is based on objects - JavaScript is based on the notion of prototypes, which are also objects. In PHP you'd say create me a new object which is an instance of class Web Developer. In a prototypal OO language like JavaScript, you'd say 'I'm going to take this object person which is lying around and reuse it as a prototype for a new object that I'll call Bob').
* Bob is based on another object, called Web Developer - prototype
Bob holds data (such as birth date) and methods that work with the data (such as calculate age) - demonstrates encapsulation.
* We don't need to know how the calculation method works internally (it might have some private data) - information hiding
* Bob is part of a Web Dev Team object, along with Jill, a Designer Object, and Jack, a Project Manager object - aggregation, composition. 

##Primitive data types

* Numbers
* Strings
* Boolean (only possible values are true or false)
* Undefined (console says this if you try and access a variable that doesn't exist. Or if you declare a variable but haven't given it a value yet - when you declare a variable without initialising it, JavaScript automatically initialises it to the value undefined). Only value of the undefined data type is the value undefined. 
* Null (special data type -  so it is defined, but it can only have one value, the null value)

##Non-primitive data types (i.e. OBJECTS!)
Anything that doesn't belong to the list of primitive data types above is an object. 
Note though that **even null is considered an object**. 

###When converted to a booleanâ€¦
All values become true when covered to a boolean, except the six falsy values: "", null, undefined, 0, Nan, false. 

###typeof Operator
`typeof n;`
Tells you the data type of a variable or a value. Will spit back: number, string, boolean, undefined, object or function. 

###NaN
Nan is a special value that is also a number. You get NaN when you try to perform an operation that assumes numbers but the operation fails. e.g. `10 * f;`

N.b. NaN is not equal to anything, not even itself. NaN == Nan will return false. 

###Operator precedence

`Operator Precedence` - assuming no parentheses that assume otherwise, * has precedence over + - so `1 + 2 * 3` is `7` not 9. Similarly in logical operators, the order is ! then && then ||.

`Best practice - use parentheses` rather than relying on operator precedence. Makes your code easier to understand! 

###Lazy Evaluation
If result becomes clear at some point before end of logical operations, the JavaScript engine becomes lazy/efficient and skips to end result. 
 
##Arrays
A more interesting **data structure** than the basic primitive data types. Arrays are of course objects. 
	
	var a = [];
	typeof a;
	// result is object
	
* An array is simply a list of values. 
* Instead of using one variable to store one value, you can **use one array variable to store any number of values as elements of the array**.

Note you can add more elements, by addressing an index that didn't exist before. 
	
	var a = [];
	var a = [1, 2, 3];
	a[3] = 4;
	
If you add a new element, but leave a gap in the array, the elements in between ()that have been missed out) are all assigned the undefined value. 

You can use the **delete operator** to delete an array element. It won't actually remove the element, but rather set its value to undefined. So after the deletion, the length of the array does not change. 

##Arrays of arrays

An array can contain any type of values - including another array. 

	var a = [1, 2, "three", false, null, [1, 2, 3]];

To access an element in the nested array: 

	a[4][2]
	//result would be 3
	
Note that you can also use the array notation to access individual characters inside a string: 

	var s = 'one';
	s[1];
	//result would be n

So to recap on arrays: 

* An array is a data store
* An array contains indexed elements
* Indexes start from zero and increment by one for each element in the array
* To access these elements, use the index inside square brackets
* An array can contain any type of data, including other arrays


##Conditions and Loops
`Conditions` provide a simple and powerful way to control the execution through a piece of code

`Loops` allow you to perform repeating operations with less code

A `code block` consists of zero or more expressions enclosed in curly brackets:

	{
		var a = 1;
		var b = 3;
	}
	
You can nest blocks within each other indefinitely. 

###if Conditions
 
	var result = '';
	if(a > 2){
		result = 'a is greater than two';
	}

3 parts to an IF condition: 

* The if statement
* The condition - **which always returns a boolean value**
* The code block to be executed if the condition is satisfied

`There is an optional ELSE part of the if condition`, which executes an alternative code block if the condition was evaluated to be false. 

	var result = '';
	if(a > 2){
		result = 'a is greater than two';
	} else{
		result = 'a is not greater than two';
	}

In between the if and the else, `there can also be an unlimited number of ELSE IF conditions`: 

	var result = '';
	if(a > 2){
		result = 'a is greater than two';
	} elseif{
		
	} elseif{
	
	}else{
		result = 'a is not greater than two';
	}

##JavaScript functions - Functions are data!

JavaScript functions are DATA - so the following two ways of defining a function are the same:  
**function f(){return 1;}**  
**var f = function(){return: 1;}**

JavaScript functions are a special kind of data with 2 important features:     

* They contain code  
* They are executable (they can be invoked)

####Annoymous Functions

In JavaScript, it's find to have pieces of anonymous data lying around - i.e. data not assigned to any variable. The code will look a bit odd and won't do anything, but it won't break your code e.g. 
`[1,2,3];`

Functions are like any other variable, so they can also be used without being assigned a name: 
`function(a){return a;}`

Annoymous pieces of data scattered around your code though are only really useful if they happen to be functions: 

* Pass an anonymous function as a parameter to another function - `Callback functions`
* Or you can define an anonymous function and execute it right away - `Self-invoking functions`

#####Callback functions
So when you pass function B to function A, and A executes B, B is known as a callback function. If it doesn't have a name, it's an anonymous callback function. 
 
Callback functions:  
* Can help with performance
* You can delegate the responsibility of calling a function to another function (so less code to write)
