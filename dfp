#DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP)

So DFP is our ad serving platform - if I need a login, it's best to ask Dean or Emma for a login. And Emma is the best person to ask when it comes to DFP stuff. 

When it comes to our ads, for Celtra, our designers create ads and pass the script tags to Emma, whilst for DoubleClick studio ads, we create them in DCStudio and pass them to Emma. But there might be some cases when we have to create ad templates directly into DFP - for example, if you wanted a responsive ad (in DoubleClick Studio, you have to set specific ad dimensions). 

In DFP, everything is called an order. If you search on CMD Test in DFP, you'll see the ad formats which we've created/tested. 

If you think of the DFP orders as equivalent to 'Advertisers' in DoubleClick Studio, and inside each order you have lots of line items (i.e. 'Campaigns'), and inside that you have lots of creatives (equivalent of 'ads').

So for example John created a template called Mobile Tryptch Banner that gets used sometimes. 

If you create a template from scratch, you'd set user options for when people use your template (such as which background colour they want etc). You can use the standard DFP placeholders in your html, such as `<a href="%%CLICK_URL_UNESC%%"â€¦`

You use inline styling in the template. 

You can also use raw javaScript, but you can't use jquery.
